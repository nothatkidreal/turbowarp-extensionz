alright ya'll
so in order for these extensions to work, they must be unsandboxed.
Meaning you can't just input the link from the github page, otherwise it will run sandboxed.
Why does it need to be unsandboxed?
- The extensions sometimes edit the html which won't work sandboxed for security reasons.

"But I don't feel safe running random code in my turbowarp!"
Try and take the time to read what the code does, some people see reading code as quite hard, but its more-so the writing that's painful.
I try and add as many comments as I can when coding, so people understand what the code does.

Thanks!
